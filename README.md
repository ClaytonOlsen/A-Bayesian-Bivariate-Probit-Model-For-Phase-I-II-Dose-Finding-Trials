# Single Early Phase Bayesian Dose-Finding methods
Traditionally, in dose-finding trials, researchers adopt a rule-based methodology for separate phase 1 and 2 trials to find the maximum tolerated dose level and evaluate the efficacy of an experimental drug. Alternatively, a single model-based, early-phase trial design can be utilized to simultaneously account for efficacy and toxicity. We propose a bivariate probit design to model the binary outcomes of efficacy and toxicity under a Bayesian framework while accounting for potential dependencies between dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity. We evaluate dose levels with an intuitive utility function, proposed in Liu and Johnson [2016], that accounts for desired trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of our proposed design versus the design in [Liu and Johnson, 2016] under various practical dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity relationships. The results show that the proposed design possesses favorable operating characteristics and can capture the shape of the dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity curves.
