# Signle Early Phase Bayesian Dose-Finding methods
 Traditionally, rule-based dose finding methods are adopted for separate phase 1 and 2 trials which aim to find the maximum tolerated dose level and evaluate efficacy of an experimental drug. Johnson a Liu (2016) proposed a single early phase trial model based approach which follows a Bayesian framework that maximizes a utility function. The utility function accounts for desired trade offs between efficacy and toxicity opposed to simply maximizing the dose level until reaching the maximum tolerated dose level. Additionally, we propose a bi-variate probit model to jointly model the binary outcomes of efficacy and toxicity. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of our proposed model versus the Johnson and Liu (2016) model under various practical circumstances.
